# Qdrant-JS: JavaScript Qdrant SDK

This package represents the JS SDK for the [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) vector search engine.

The next packages are re-exported from it:

-   [JS Client REST](../js-client-rest)
-   [JS Client gRPC](../js-client-grpc) (coming soon)

## Contributing

These are the most relevant scripts for development:

-   `pnpm build`: builds and bundles from TypeScript sources
-   `pnpm pre-check`: type-checks sources
-   `pnpm pre-commit`: same as pre-check, but for git hooks (husky)
